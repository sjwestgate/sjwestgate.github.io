I am a fourth-year MPhys student at the University of Manchester, UK. Welcome!

I have just finished working with Bruce Kane and Joyce Coppock at the University of Maryland in the US, where I have been levitating nanoparticles of Polystyrene for a semester and working on simulations in COMSOL for the semester before that. My next project is working with armoured bubbles in Manchester for the summer.

Read my Manchester on the road blog post about my year in the US [here](https://manchesterontheroad.com/2025/04/07/adventures-in-america/).
