I am a fourth-year MPhys student at the University of Manchester, UK. Welcome!

I have just finished a summer project working on armoured bubbles in Manchester. Last year I was at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences in College Park, Maryland, levitating nanoparticles and shooting lasers at them.

Read my Manchester on the road blog post about my year in the US [here](https://manchesterontheroad.com/2025/04/07/adventures-in-america/).

You can find my friend Frances' blog about UMD [here](https://francesmaryconnoll.wixsite.com/my-life-at-umd-1).

In October I am running the Manchester Half Marathon for Alzheimer's Society! [Click here if you're feeling generous!](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/sarahwestgate-67ec8d28e86dfe9c418466e6?utm_medium=FA&utm_source=CL)
